# Roadmap

This is the IPFS Cluster Roadmap for the next months. Note that this is a declaration of our best intentions but it is very difficult to make compromises. We keep this page updated regularly.

## Short term (Q4 2019)

* Adoption of the stateless PinTracker implementation
* Support and improvements to the CRDT implementation
* Usability improvements and small fixes
* DAG Sharding support (ongoing)
* Key metrics for prometheus
* Workshops and conference talks

## Mid term (6-8 months horizon)

* RPC streaming
* "ipfs-cluster-follower" application with a nice set of default archives for people to follow.
* Stable collaborations with different players interested in using ipfs-cluster/ipfs.
* Sharding support and good sharding support for at least ~1TB datasets (package repositories).
* Exploring support for a rich set of allocation strategies e.g. by geographic location or as a function of access patterns

## Long term (~1 year+)

* Additional chunking/sharding/encoding strategies. FEC support.
* Tested to 10s of millions of peers
