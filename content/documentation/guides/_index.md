# Guides

**TODO**

**The Guides section explains how to perform certain tasks in depth. How do I accomplish a thing, and the use case is narrowly defined. There are use cases that we know about -- such as using Cluster to run a pinning service or using Cluster to do X -- and users have been asking us to have opinions about how to best tune Cluster and IPFS. We should address those in Guides.**
