# Download IPFS Cluster

**This should be a simpler version of the current Download and Install page. Here’s dist.ipfs.io, or here’s the Docker name for it, and that’s it. The install from source instructions don’t need to be there -- we can point to the other Download and Install page in Docs. Or something. We’re not 100% sure. But the current page is too much :)**
